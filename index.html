            <h2>What are colors?</h2>
            <p>
                We don't really know.
                A scientist might tell you that colors are lightwaves between 400-700 nanometers.
                An artist might tell you that they are the ingredients for expression casserole.

                The nature and origin of colors is shrouded in mystery.
                For example, do we create linguistic terms to describe colors we perceive, or do we perceive colors because we have terms to describe them?
                Do they affect us because they intrinsically provoke specific responses in us, or do they provoke those responses in us because we are socially-conditioned to perceive "blue" as sad or "red" as invigorating?

                All we know is that special birds gather fruit of unique hues and bring them to a council of elders to name, and that's how we categorize colors today.
            </p>

            <h2>How long have colors existed?</h2>
            <p>
                Scientists are not sure for how long colors have existed. On the one hand, references to color date back to Aristotle,
                and the 40,000-year-old cave paintings in Lubang Jeriji Saleh contain color. On the other hand, we do not know if Aristotle
                was speaking theoretically or if he had colors, nor if the cave paintings were painted in color or became colorized at
                a later date. We do know that color photography has existed since 1861, indicating that stationary colors have existed
                for hundreds of years!
            </p>

            <h2>Are they safe?</h2>
            <p>
                Although we can confirm that mobile colors have existed for over one hundred years (the first
                color film, <em>A Visit to the Seaside</em>, was released in 1908), their long-term effects on health and the
                environment are still poorly understood.
