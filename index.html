            <h2>What are colors?</h2>
            <p>
                We don't really know.
                A scientist might tell you that colors are lightwaves between 400-700 nanometers.
                An artist might tell you that they are the ingredients for expression casserole.
                Who knows who is right?

                The nature and origin of colors is shrouded in mystery.
                What makes "purple" purple? Do you and I see the same hue when we say "green"?
                Do we create words to describe colors we see, or do we see colors because we have words for them?
                What about the effects they have on us? Are those intrinsic to the color, or do they provoke those responses in us because we are socially-conditioned to perceive "blue" as sad or "red" as invigorating?

                Whatever they are, they add variety and excitement to life, and we here at <em>Colors</em> are dedicated to unlocking the mystery!
            </p>

            <h2>How long have colors existed?</h2>
            <p>
                Scientists are not sure for how long colors have existed. On the one hand, references to color date back to Aristotle,
                and the 40,000-year-old cave paintings in Lubang Jeriji Saleh contain color. On the other hand, we do not know if Aristotle
                was speaking theoretically or if he had colors, nor if the cave paintings were painted in color or became colorized at
                a later date. We do know that color photography has existed since 1861, indicating that stationary colors have existed
                for hundreds of years!
            </p>

            <h2>Are they safe?</h2>
            <p>
                Although we can confirm that mobile colors have existed for over one hundred years (the first
                color film, <em>A Visit to the Seaside</em>, was released in 1908), their long-term effects on health and the
                environment are still poorly understood.
